# Using-GCN_LSTM-to-predict-financial-risk
The main purpose of our repository is to construct a GCN-LSTM model for financial risk prediction.

## LSTM (Pytorch)
We construct an LSTM model based on the PyTorch structure. In our example experiment, the Chinese stock market index and corresponding features are considered as the sample data. First, we provide a Data_process.py file to preprocess the research data. Then, the LSTM_pytorch.py file consists of thre main parts including LSTM model, Model Construction, and Model Prediction.
